## 👩‍🔧 Getting Started 

These instructions will provide you a copy of the project that you can run locally. Visit [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/ "PythonAnywhere") to set up a free account if you would like to host.

## 🛠️ Install

**Step 1:** Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. 
```python
git clone git@github.com:vwingardh/Coffio.git
```

**Step 2:** Create a virual environment for web app.
```python
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 3:** Activate virtual environment with following command.
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 4:** Install all packages in requirements.txt file in project directory.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 5:** By default Django uses SQLite, this app uses PostgreSQL. To use SQLite, change the database code in settings.py to: 
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

Otherwise, create a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin and configure NAME and PASSWORD to that of your newly created PostgreSQL database.

**Step 6:** Generate a new secret key and add to SECRET_KEY in settings.py. Run key_generator.py to generate a new key or use [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/ "Djecrety") to generate a secret key.

**Step 7:** Create a .env file in the root directory (where manage.py is) to secure secret key and database credentials. 

**Step 8:** Delete existing migrations and migrate to new database.
```python
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate
```

**Step 9:** Create a superuser for access to the admin panel.
```python
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Step 10:** Start the development server and ensure there are no errors.
```python
python manage.py runserver
```
